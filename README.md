# BnrPostApi

Web API project to manage CRUD operations for a post service.  This was started as part of an interview coding project and I just wanted to play around with it more. The master branch contains the initial four hours of work. Other branches contain further enhancements to the service.

The AddSqlDatabase branch contains Sqlite database and two versions of the controller. One version was coded from scratch while the other (PostsController) was auto generated using a model and db context.
